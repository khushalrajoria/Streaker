# Streaker

Streaker is a Flutter app that helps you maintain streaks by allowing you to add and track different habits. You can set daily reminders to keep yourself on track, and the app will reset your streak if you miss a day.

## Features

* Add and track different streaks
* Set daily reminders
* View your current streak for each habit
* See your longest streak for each habit
* No option to delete streaks without completing them (helps you stay motivated!)


## Getting Started

To get started using Streaker, you'll need to have Flutter installed on your development machine. You can find instructions on how to install Flutter here: [https://flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/get-started/install)

Once you have Flutter installed, clone this repository and run the following commands to get started:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/khushalrajoria/Streaker]
cd Streaker
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

This will start the Streaker app on your device.

## Usage

To add a new streak, tap on the "+" button in the bottom right corner of the screen. Enter a name for your streak and optionally set a daily reminder. Then, tap on the "Save" button.

To view your current streak for a habit, tap on the habit card. The app will display your current streak count and your longest streak for that habit.
